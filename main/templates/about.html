                        <p class="mb-4">This project has stemmed from a Machine Learning Engineering challenge from
                            Weaviate. The challenge
                            revolved around making a workflow using some of Weaviate's core tools. At its core, Weaviate
                            is an
                            open-source vector database that has additional tooling to help you interact with and
                            analyze your
                            data.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">One track of the challenge involved clustering and analysis of a dataset
                            containing job postings from LinkedIn over 2023-24.
                            Using this as our jumping-off point, this is what the core of the website is centered
                            around, visualizing the relationship between job listings and user defined terms.</p>


                        <p class="mb-4">Let's have a look at how Weaviate to utilized to achieve this.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">We won't cover off everything about Vector Databases here, but there is a <a
                        href="https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">good explainer from Weaviate</a>. But let's cover of some of the points
                    that we need for later on:</p>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3 class="title is-4">Vectors</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">In the context of machine learning, a <b>vector</b> is a mathematical representation
                        of an object or concept in a high-dimensional space, or put simply an array of numbers
                        [0.1,0.3,-0.2,...].</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3 class="title is-4">Embedding</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">An <b>embedding</b> is the process of converting data (in our case text data about
                        job listings) into a <b>vector</b> representation that captures the semantic meaning and
                        relationships of the data. We do this using the OpenAI embedding model: "text-embedding-3-small"
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3 class="title is-4">Cosine Distance</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Now we have our job listing data represented as a <b>vector</b> we can easily
                        calculate the distance between 2 vectors by using the cosine distance.
                        The cosine distance is cosine similarity represented in positive space, and is calculated using
                        this:</p>

                    <pre class="mb-4"><code>cos_sim = np.dot(a, b)/(np.linalg.norm(a)*(np.linalg.norm(b)))
cos_distance =  1 - cos_sim</pre></code>
<p class="mb-4"> This is what is represented on the X,Y and Z axis of the chart on the main page. We take the <b>vector</b> which is an <b>embedding</b> of the data for a single job listing and then we calculate the distance from each of the <b>embeddings</b> for the axis (Data Scientist, Accountant, etc.). Then using these distance we can plot the cosine distances on a 3 axis plot.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h2 class="title is-4">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">RAG is a technique that enhances large language models by providing additional context when querying. In the context the project, RAG adds an additional step between our provided axis and their embedding. Here's a quick representation of how this works in this application. </p>
                <figure class="image">
                    <img src="{% static 'img/RAG_diagram.png' %}" alt="RAG Diagram">
                </figure>
                <p class="mb-4"> This image show that when using RAG, after we generate our initial vector embedding of our axis ("Data Scientist"), Weaviate is used to search our vector database to find similar results, summarize those results, embed that summary, and then use that embedding to calculate our cosine distances.</p>
