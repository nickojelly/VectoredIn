##  Project Overview

VectoredIn is a web application that allows users to explore and gain insights from job market data. It leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to process and analyze job listings. 

## Features 

### 3D Plot of Semantic Distance




##  Technologies Used

-  Python
-  Django web framework
-  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-  Plotly for interactive visualizations
-  OpenAI API for generating embeddings
-  Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for efficient similarity search
-  Weaviate for vector storage and retrieval

## Highlights
